The graphs presented in the document are a series of bar charts illustrating the variation in the F-Measure metric for different types of noise applied to cloud NLP services provided by Amazon, Google, and Microsoft. Each graph represents a specific type of noise, such as Antonym, Word Embeddings, Word Split, Word Swap, Char Swap, Contextual Word Embeds, Keyboard, OCR, Random Char Replace, Spelling, and Synonym.

The graphs share the following common features:

- The x-axis represents noise levels from 0% to 90%, indicating the degree of disturbance inserted into the text.
- The y-axis shows the F-Measure, a metric that combines precision and recall to evaluate the effectiveness of NLP services under noisy conditions.
- Each graph includes three data series, each corresponding to one of the service providers (Amazon, Google, Microsoft), allowing for a direct comparison among them under the same noise conditions.

These graphs allow viewers to see how different types of noise impact the effectiveness of cloud NLP services, highlighting which provider maintains better performance under adverse conditions. Additionally, a spreadsheet (grouped_data_new.xlsx) is provided that will allow for the generation of additional graphs. This spreadsheet contains the necessary data to explore various noise impacts further and compare the cloud NLP services under different scenarios not covered in the initial set of graphs. This added resource enhances the ability to conduct a comprehensive analysis and make informed decisions regarding the selection of NLP services based on robustness against noise.
